# **Hands-on Exercise 4: Visual Statistical Analysis**

## **Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot**

[**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

-   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default.

-   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting.

## **Getting Started**

In this exercise, **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### **Importing data**

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### **One-sample test: *gghistostats()* method**

In the code chunk below, [*gghistostats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

### **Unpacking the Bayes Factor**

-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

-   That's because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

![](https://isss608-ay2022-23jan.netlify.app/hands-on_ex/hands-on_ex04/img/image5.jpg)

-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

\
**How to interpret Bayes Factor**

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one---first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

### **Two-sample mean test: *ggbetweenstats()***

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

### **Oneway ANOVA Test: *ggbetweenstats()* method**

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

-   "ns" → only non-significant

-   "s" → only significant

-   "all" → everything

```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```

In this code chunk below [*ggbarstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association

```{r}
ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)
```

            output = "plot")
```

# **Hands-on Exercise 4: Visualising Uncertainty**

## **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates**

-   A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean.

-   Uncertainty is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval

-   Important:

    -   Don't confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate)
```

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods**

The code chunk below performs the followings:

-   group the observation by RACE,

-   computes the count of observations, mean, standard deviation and standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   save the output as a tibble data table called `my_sum`.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

Note: For the mathematical explanation, please refer to Slide 20 of Lesson 4.

Next, the code chunk below will

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

\
**Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods**

The code chunk below is used to reveal the standard error of mean maths score by race.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean 
          maths score by race")
```

## **Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package**

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis"));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +   #<<
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_gradientinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## **Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

Step 1: Installing ungeviz package

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")

```

Note: You only need to perform this step once.

Step 2: Launch the application in R

```{r}
library(ungeviz)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, color = "#0072B2", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)












































































































































































































































































```

## **Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), 
            y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3,

```

# **Hands-on Exercise 4: Building Funnel Plot with R**

## **Overview**

Funnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:

-   plotting funnel plots by using **funnelPlotR** package,

-   plotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and

-   plotting interactive funnel plot by using both **plotly R** and **ggplot2** packages.

## **Installing and Launching R Packages**

In this exercise, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   **readr** for importing csv into R.

-   **FunnelPlotR** for creating funnel plot.

-   **ggplot2** for creating funnel plot manually.

-   **knitr** for building static html table.

-   **plotly** for creating interactive funnel plot.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)
```

## **Importing Data**

In this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from [Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/). For this hands-on exercise, we are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.

The code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called *covid19*.

```{r}
covid19 <- read_csv("data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv") %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
```

## **FunnelPlotR methods**

[**FunnelPlotR**](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/FunnelPlotR/) package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a `numerator` (events of interest), `denominator` (population to be considered) and `group`. The key arguments selected for customisation are:

-   `limit`: plot limits (95 or 99).

-   `label_outliers`: to label outliers (true or false).

-   `Poisson_limits`: to add Poisson limits to the plot.

-   `OD_adjust`: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.

-   `xrange` and `yrange`: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.

-   Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.

### **FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Positive,
  denominator = covid19$Death,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`
)
```

    A funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. 
    Plot is adjusted for overdispersion.

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `group` in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.

-   By default, `data_type`argument is "SR".

-   `limit`: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.

### **FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Death,
  denominator = covid19$Positive,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",     
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  
  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   
)
```

A funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. Plot is adjusted for overdispersion.

Things to learn from the code chunk above. + `data_type` argument is used to change from default "SR" to "PR" (i.e. proportions). + `xrange` and `yrange` are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis\

### **FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Death,
  denominator = covid19$Positive,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",   
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  
  yrange = c(0, 0.05),
  label = NA,
  title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<           
  x_label = "Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases", 
  y_label = "Cumulative Fatality Rate"  
)
```

A funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers.

Plot is adjusted for overdispersion.

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `label = NA` argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.

-   `title` argument is used to add plot title.

-   `x_label` and `y_label` arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.

## **Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods**

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.

### **Computing the basic derived fields**

To plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.

```{r}
df <- covid19 %>%
  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%
  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%
  filter(rate > 0)
```

Next, the *fit.mean* is computed by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
fit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)
```

### **Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI**

The code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
number.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)
number.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
dfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)
```

### **Plotting a static funnel plot**

In the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), 
             alpha=0.4) +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(data = dfCI, 
             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), 
             size = 0.4, 
             colour = "grey40") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = "95%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = "99%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") +
  xlab("Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") + 
  ylab("Cumulative Fatality Rate") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=7),
        legend.background = element_rect(colour = "grey60", linetype = "dotted"),
        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "cm"))
p
```

### **Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2**

The funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with `ggplotly()` of **plotly** r package.

```{r}
fp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,
  tooltip = c("label", 
              "x", 
              "y"))
fp_ggplotly
```
